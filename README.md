# Epokingine's Game Engine

A small easy to use game engine written in Rust, using X11 windowing system

### Event Driven

All actions done by EGE are from defined events that can be timed, conditional, or every time the main loop runs.

### Entity tracking

With very limited implementation you can define any data structure and easily store and obtain it's contents.

Entities can be linked together allowing developers to manage them easily.

## Requirements:
    - rustc v1.81.0+
    - X11 v1.20.0+
